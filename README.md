# Bluetooth LE Library for Android

This library allows for easy access to a Bluetooth LE device's Advertisement Records.
It also offers:

* A simple running average RSSI reading keeping.
* For iBeacons: Manufacturer data record parser.
* For iBeacons: Distance indicators (Near, Far, Immediate, Unknown).
* For iBeacons: A decently inaccurate (due to real world issues) distance approximation.
* All the new object types are Parcelable.

This will only work on devices with Android 4.3 (API Level 18) and above.

## Including the Library in Your Project

This project is available as an artifact for use with Gradle. To use that, add the following blocks to your build.gradle file:
```groovy
	repositories {
		maven {
			url "https://dl.bintray.com/alt236/maven"
		}
	}

	dependencies {
		compile 'uk.co.alt236:bluetooth-le-library-android:1.0.0'
	}
```
If you *really* need a Jar file, fork the project and execute `./gradlew clean build generateRelease` at the root of the project.
This will create a zip file under `<PROJECT_ROOT>/library/build/` the Jar can be found inside.

## Using the Library
In the `onLeScan()` method of your `BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback()` create a new BluetoothLeDevice with the given information.

For example:

```java
	private BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback mLeScanCallback = new BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback() {

		@Override
		public void onLeScan(final BluetoothDevice device, int rssi, byte[] scanRecord) {

			final BluetoothLeDevice deviceLe = new BluetoothLeDevice(device, rssi, scanRecord, System.currentTimeMillis());

			runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
				@Override
				public void run() {
					mDeviceStore.addDevice(deviceLe);
					mLeDeviceListAdapter.replaceData(mDeviceStore.getDeviceList());
				}

			});
		}
	};
```

### Device Properties

Once you have created a device, you can access the following methods:

* `getAddress()` : Gets the MAC Address of the device
* `getAdRecordStore()`: Gives access to a device's Ad Records
* `getDevice()`: Gives access to the standard BluetoothDevice object
* `getFirstRssi()`: Retrieves the RSSI value which was used when the object was created
* `getFirstTimestamp()` Retrieves the timestamp (in millis) which was used when the object was created
* `getRssi()` Gets the current RSSI measurement (see note below).
* `getScanRecord()` Retrieves the RAW scan record array
* `getTimestamp()` Gets the timestamp of the last RSSI measurement
* `getRunningAverageRssi()` Retrieves the internally calculated running average RSSI value (see note below).


**Note:** The Running Average RSSI is not updated automatically (i.e. the library does not monitor on its own in the background). To add another measurement, you need to call `updateRssiReading(long timestamp, int rssiReading)`.


### Accessing the Advertisement (Ad) Records

Once you've created a BluetoothLe device, you can access the AdRecord store via the `leDevice.getAdRecordStore()`. Once you have the AdRecordStore you can use the following methods:

* `getRecord(int recordNo)`: Gets the AdRecord object corresponding to the recordNumber.
* `getRecordDataAsString(int recordNo)` : Gets the AdRecord contents as a String (expect non printable characters in most cases).
* `isRecordPresent(int recordNo)`: Checks to see if a record exists.

**Note:** Record numbers are declared in the Bluetooth 4 spec which can be found [here](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/core-specification.aspx).
They are also declared as constants in `AdRecord.java`.

### Fun with iBeacons
You can check if a device is an iBeacon by using `BeaconUtils.getBeaconType(BluetootLeDevice device)`. Once you have confirmed that it is, you can create a new IBeaconDevice via the IBeaconDevice constructor.

Example Flow:
```java
	final BluetoothLeDevice device = ... // A generic BLE device

	if (BeaconUtils.getBeaconType(device) == BeaconType.IBEACON) {
		final IBeaconDevice iBeacon = new IBeaconDevice(device);
		// DO STUFF
	}
```

An IBeaconDevice extends BluetoothLeDevice, so you still have access to the same methods as before. In addition you can do the following:

* `getAccuracy()`: Gets the estimated Accuracy of the reading in meters based on a simple running average calculation
* `getCalibratedTxPower()`: Gets the calibrated TX power of the iBeacon device as reported
* `getCompanyIdentifier()`: Gets the iBeacon company identifier (this should always be 0x004C for Apple)
* `getDistanceDescriptor()`: Gets the estimated Distance descriptor (an enum)
* `getIBeaconData()`: Gets the raw IBeaconManufacturerData object.
* `getUUID()`: Gets the device's UUID
* `getMajor()`: Gets the device's Major value
* `getMinor()`: Gets the device's Minor value


### Lookup Functions
You can also lookup values and convert them to human friendly strings:
* `BluetoothClassResolver.resolveDeviceClass(int btClass)`: Will try to resolve a Blueotooth Device class
* `CompanyIdentifierResolver.getCompanyName(int companyId, String fallback)`: Will try to resolve a Company identifier to the company name
* `GattAttributeResolver.getAttributeName(String uuid, String fallback)`: Will try to convert a UUID to its name.

**Note:** The data can be found as ODS (Open Office Spreadsheets) in the documents folder.

## Library Changelog

## Permission Explanation
You will need the following permissions to access the Bluetooth Hardware

* `android.permission.BLUETOOTH`
* `android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`

In addition one of the following is needed from API 23 and above to scan for BT LE devices:
* `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
* `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION `

## TODO

* Tidy up Javadoc. There is quite a lot of it that is template
* Add parsers for common Ad Records.
